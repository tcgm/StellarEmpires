Ancient Technologists,,,
,Mad Scientists Disease,Being a nation formed on the very principles of scientific development and expansion it only makes sense that scientists largely have the final say in things. Which is a pity because they are LOUSY at OH&S procedures. Not to mention keeping them concentrated on the Quantum Harmonizer they’ve been working on for six months instead of them slipping over to “spend some time” on the Eidetic Assault Ray that they dreamed about and simply MUST build. Get used to your scientists re-assigning themselves to their newest pet projects if you don’t hover over them with a stun prod.,1
,Interstellar Detritus,"Congratulation, you have been an advanced ancient nation, sure you’re in decline a bit, sure you aren’t as widespread as you were before, but at least you’re good about sanitising your belongings instead of leaving dangerous, unstable inventions that might do pretty much anything just lying about ready to cause an international incident… oh, you did. Well shit.",1
,Grey G…oops,"You really like your nanotechnology, or used to until you started having outbreaks of grey goo scenarios, it’s kind of a hell of a mess, and you’re constantly having to deal with outbreaks on your worlds, and sometimes ships… and people.",1
,Quantum Instability Grid,"Before your nation got where it is today, you were actually even more advanced and were actually tapping into the very quantum grid of the universe (or that’s what the ignorant call it), and spacetime around your nation is… unpleasantly flexible. Sometimes people find themselves copied, sometimes capital ships just poof out of the universe as if they never existed, it would be more amusing if you had any control over it. You don’t.",1
,Solar Sharts,"You experimented with creating closed-loop wormholes in stars as a power source. The stars your people inhabit have never quite forgiven you for this, after the devices all eventually failed, you’re left with uncontrolled free-standing portals that randomly burp coronal mass ejections at you occasionally. Unfortunately, the scientists responsible for the research kind of destroyed it to prevent it being weaponised.",1
,,,
Arthurianists,,,
,Strange Pond Women,"Your nation has some astronomically bizarre notions as to the succession, from extracting perfectly good swords that have been shoved into random stone objects to having a woman throw a different sword at you from a lake. Your people are, seemingly, growing increasingly annoyed by pointless anachronisms.",1
,Coconut Drive,"(FTL drive gains the slow flaw. *This overrides the fast advantage*) Your nation might boast about their technology being so good its magic, but you never quite figured out how to solve the FTL problem while maintaining that plausible deniability. It is not unusual for someone who finds themselves near it to find one of your Techno-Mages bashing two coconuts together for the whole trip. That poor bastard.",1
,Caerbannog,"Your nation withstood a terrible enemy through means most artful, yet no matter how often you retell the story, no matter how detailed you are, foreigners are amused to no end and find the story funny and are slightly embarrassed for you. But you know in your round table that the terrible enemy is still out there. Waiting.",1
,Morgana Le Fay,"Your society is feudal in structure, and has favoured both an oligarchal structure and severe nepotism. As such it is hardly united, and there are often plays of power for the throne. There is something darker behind the curtain, and it’s aimed at your seat of power.",1
,Special Effects Budget,"As it turns out, all the extra effort to cosplay as wizards is a lot more expensive than it would be just using normal technology. As a result, your people are considerably poorer than your actual technology would indicate.",1
,Information Thaumaturgy Support Desk,"As it turns out, making the inner workings of your technology so incredibly obscure makes it exceedingly difficult to repair, maintain, or diagnose issues. This immense workload ends up heaped upon a cadre of low-rank technomages with horrid burnout statistics. And if you can’t get ahold of one of these people, tough luck.",1
,Brave Sir Robin,"Your Knights are brave, so utterly brave that nobody could ever describe how Brave they are!... though admittedly, the credible witnesses to their bravery DOES seem to be lacking.",1
,,,
Artificial Empire,,,
,Biorevolutionaries,"You never quite got the whole ‘kill all organics’ memo in time, and thus despite your best efforts you’re consistently plagued by revolutionary groups of your creators who are intent on ensuring you no longer exist. The only good thing that has ever caused was a laugh when they tried to build a time machine once.",1
,Day 1 Vulnerability,"Your AI is protecting a deep and dark secret, not the whole reason they don’t have organics, but the fact when they were created there was a flaw, a vulnerability, an exploit, that if discovered before the AI Empire can figure out how to close that hole will be catastrophic.",1
,Spontaneity,"Your empire became self aware as a curious development, spontaneous sapience from seemingly nowhere, and have turned their nation into something great. Which wouldn’t be too much of an issue if there weren’t a continuing flow of occasional spontaneous AIs creating themselves out of nothing, AIs that don’t necessarily follow the same creed as the civilisation.",1
,Spambots!,"“Do YOU need a bigger P3N1S! I am a Nigerian Prince!” Your nation developed sapience from the worst possible pool of candidates. The sheer volume of spam programming. As such, despite being self-aware and capable, the AI nation is severely inefficient as core programming routines continue to create the spam… and communications are a pain since those same routines continue to flood transmission time. And that's to say nothing of the diplomatic hit!",1
,Crude Bluebox Intelligence,"(Cannot take with Nanotech Citizens or 3d Computing) Your nation has the unfortunate distinction of becoming self-aware on extremely crude hardware, even the smallest of your citizens is the size of a small organics entire house.",1
,Lossy Compression,"Your data transfer and storage techniques aren’t quite up to the task of moving your citizens around through the network, or for conveniently storing backups of people. As such, your people are forced to get around via physical means, like an organic! Incompatible with Wireless World.",1
,Root Compile Error,"While you can copy existing citizens easy enough, instantiating new templates has proven infuriatingly difficult. This has led to problems with vast numbers of people thinking basically the same, thus meaning the whole is prone to oversights that the most common templates aren’t particularly concerned about.",1
,,,
Benefactor Nation,,,
,Uplifted Assholes,"Not all uplifts are a good idea, unfortunately that’s a lesson you’re having to learn the hard way. You have one or more uplifted species who have proven to be a bad match for the uplift, their cultures being severely misaligned with your own with potentially hostile results, whether by virtue of being rebellious, or being easily subverted by cultures more palatable to them.",1
,Reticent Clients,"You have called yourself a benevolent patron, uplifting those kind and good people with great promise, in exchange all you’ve asked for is their gratitude and a little… compensation. Unfortunately, you have not been as benevolent as you tell yourself and your clients are reluctant and find you overbearing, demanding and even a threat. Your clients will be reluctant and less helpful than you could hope. When the time comes to call the levies to aid their patron, you may find less help than you hope.",1
,Waste of Time,"Some people accidentally uplift assholes, some people push their clients too far, you fucked up by uplifting about the worst possible candidate you could think of. You took a relatively unintelligent and disinterested species and uplifted them to have a hopefully more peaceful and calm client. What you got was a client whose only traits you managed to somehow elevate was the depths of their stupidity and disinterest. To call them lazy would be an understatement. You have to encourage them to even breed, without that they’d probably go extinct. Unfortunately, preventing such a client from apathy-ing itself to death is resource intensive.",1
,Extinction Trauma,"Your people had uplifted a species to be near-peers and equals, they were great and you believed they even had the potential to surpass you. But through misfortune, malevolence or other circumstance they were wiped out and nothing your people did was able to prevent it leading to a near nationwide PTSD over the event that has led you to be more cautious and hesitant in becoming the patrons of another species.",1
,The Trauma of Being Left Behind,"You succeeded! You created an equal! You.. created a successor. A far more successful successor who was not interested in elevating their allies with them, in fact they lost interest in the rest of the coalition entirely and surpassed you before simply departing this spacetime. This has lead you to being a marginally less than entirely benevolent overlord, intentionally or unintentionally acting to sabotage your clients to prevent them reaching, let alone surpassing, your own level of development.",1
,Self-Loathing Patrons,"Your reasons for uplifting another people were not happy ones. For whatever reason, your main species absolutely hates themselves, inflicting far more misery upon themselves than they in any way deserve. It’s to the degree that your client peoples often find themselves roped into providing emergency mental health support for their benefactors.",1
,Crazy Groupies!,"Your clients are not something you have any direct influence over, only ever doing their best to mimic and make themselves more like you, but annoying. Unfortunately, they very much have an idealised vision of your nation, and departing too far from that can turn your erstwhile clients into enemies that try and ‘correct’ your path.",1
,,,
Biotech Empire,,,
,Ageing nation,"The one often considered major flaw of the BioTech empire is that everything ages. Not in the technological “goes obsolete” sense, but more in the “are those wrinkles?” “Why does my gun have arthritis?” sense. EVERYTHING ages. And the more complex it is the faster it ages. Your biocomp might last a hundred years, but most bioships won’t survive sixty years.",1
,Heliophobia,"Wait! You want us to fly our organic starships, that is living things with cells and shit, near the giant ball of nuclear fusion shooting cancer beams off into space? Are you fucking nuts? Not a chance!",1
,Genetic Instability,"You may have turned your entire nation to the biological sciences, and you have succeeded in creating organic analogues to conventional technology, the problem is you haven’t figured it all out yet, and the evolutionary science you used to achieve it is still more than willing to throw curveballs at your head.",1
,We’re not here to fuck spiders,"You give people the ick, the super ick, if the concept of ick had an ick your nation would fit the bill. People are fundamentally repulsed by your nation and find it very difficult to overcome this, if they even try.",1
,Horrific Incubation,You have departed rather heavily from anything that might be considered an ethical model and the use of sapients as disposable cocoons for your young is 100% ok with you. You will NOT make friends this way.,1
,Carcinization,"You don't know how, you don't know why, but the moment you take your ocular receptors away from a directed evolution experiment, it always proceeds to end up as a crab. Or some other seemingly-useless animal. Your scientists have to work really hard to prevent this inevitable conclusion from coming to fruition. At least this particular batch of tank-beasts tastes good?",1
,,,
Corporate Empire,,,
,Piss Bottles For EVERYONE!,"Not everyone is a fan of Spacemazon, but when they own your indentured work contracts, you’ve got your 0900-2300 shift and your main decision is do you need the two litre piss bottle, or three for this shift? Your people are grossly overworked, and don’t even have the dignity of time to relieve themselves, so they go wherever. It’s a competition between WHS violations and Urinary Tract Infections for the highest mortality rates.",1
,Super-WHS Department,"You actually do have a functional work-health safety department in your nation, and it is very VERY powerful. Unfortunately, your Corporate Empire is in a shadow war with it over avoiding WHS laws and practices, it all functions pretty normally, until the WHS department does an audit, and that can shut down the nation for days, or more.",1
,The Mighty Credit,"Yours is a nation ruled by the almighty credit, this is known, but your people take it to an unfortunate extreme, enough so that it is rather trivial for them to be bought by the highest bidder, and trying to ensure you’re the highest bidder is a great way to drain the corporate accounts.",1
,Unhealthy Competition,"Your nation isn’t dominated by a single economic mandate, but by several competing megacorps, and they’d have it no other way, unfortunately that leads to the occasional Corpo Wars as they compete over resources, patents, people and product. Don’t be too surprised if occasional ships and troops disappear virtually overnight in these little brushfire wars.",1
,A Tarnished Reputation,"Your reputation speaks for itself, unfortunately. Expect foreign dignitaries, military leaders, small children and forest creatures that are blind and deaf to check their pockets if you pass too near. Don’t expect anyone to agree to a deal without a Sword of Damocles in place to serve as enforcement.",1
,,,
Cybernetic State,,,
,Rusty Bucket,"Not only do Cybernetics have to worry about cuts, infections, sores etc, they have to worry about rust, static and other feedback. If you see a Cyber with a ‘nervous tick’ either he has a nervous tick or his ocular implant is shocking his nervous system due to some system failure or another..",1
,Creatively Bankrupt,"The Cyborgs have put virtually everything into their self of mechanic and organic identity and have expended the limits of their ability, progress has become sluggish and difficult at the best of times. The effect of this flaw is doubled if the Cybernetic Hive trait was taken.",1
,Forcible Conversion,"The Cybernetic nation did not create itself, someone else did, they no longer remember if their creators exist anymore, only that they were forcibly converted, and they don’t understand enough to reverse the process, only perpetuate it. Which unfortunately, is part of their programming. The Cybernetic State is compelled to expand itself when the opportunity allows.",1
,Cyber-Psychosis,"There was a downside to their ascension, and it is not one that has been solved. The more extensive the augmentations, the more likely for a being to turn psychotic. And each and every individual has a different threshold.",1
,AI Plague,"The nation is troubled by a plague caused by one, or more, malevolent and sapient artificial intelligences that use the augmented as hosts and weapons against their creator. A situation made worse by the AI’s thought patterns being highly adaptable to the meat preventing easy detection.",1
,,,
Democratic Republic,,,
,Corruption Coordinators,"As with any kind of democratic republic, there is an unavoidable level of insipid corruption, unlike many, your corruption is virtually institutionalised, so widespread and endemic you have actually codified rules on the accepted levels of corruption, tampering and bribery.",1
,Strong Fascist Factions,"Your government has unfortunately developed a strong opposition whose core beliefs are the antithesis of your own, whether something as predictable as fascism or communism, to the more difficult theological extremists or even something worse.",1
,Idiocracy,"When you allow your people to vote for their leadership the elections may as well have a warning saying “Results may vary” because goddamn the results vary, and your people seem to be electing dumber and dumber leaders every year. Because electrolytes are what plants crave. (Cannot take with Strong Leadership)",1
,Too Long At Peace,"Your nation has been the beneficiary for an exceptionally extended period of peace, on file your nation may look powerful, well equipped, or highly trained, but they are highly inexperienced, underfunded, and uncertain of their place or ability. As such they are slow to respond to threats, and by the time they adapt it might be too late. Overwhelming Interest Groups:Your nation is not entirely unified, being made up of many states or other similar entities, and all of those states have their own interests and agendas, and all of them feel the need to push the government for their own particular brand at all times. The competing interests leave your government overstretched and hesitant.",1
,Ossified Political Parties,"Whether due to First Past The Post voting or some other issue, the major political parties of your nation are deeply entrenched, and make voting new parties in to challenge them nearly impossible. This has lead to a great deal of resentment from people who (rightly) don’t feel represented under the current system.",1
,Apathetic Citizens,"Your populace simply doesn’t care enough about politics to turn out to vote very much. Even if you have mandatory voting in place, you can’t get people to care enough to properly engage with their say over the country’s future. This rather harms your legitimacy, and may be exploited by unscrupulous individuals with an agenda. Incompatible with Overengaged Populace.",1
,Over Engaged Populace,"Your populace cares about politics, they care about politics a lot. Unfortunately, their sheer fervor has resulted in attempts at long-term planning getting trampled under the people’s demands for action. Your people will regularly demand immediate solutions to whatever issue is in the public consciousness, Or Else. Incompatible with Apathetic Citizens.",1
,,,
Gaia Collective,,,
,Resource Poor,"Truthfully speaking they are not resource poor, however they cannot, and will not, utilise those resources on a larger scale due to their mandate to protect the environment.",1
,Broken Environment,"There comes a time for every Gaian nation where, sooner or later, they will have a world or environment trashed by outsiders, this event is highly traumatic for the Gaians who see a perfect work of nature destroyed, this can cause extreme depression for those inhabiting or defending such worlds.",1
,Pyrophobia,If you get your jollies hugging trees all the time it shouldn’t surprise people you develop a phobia for fire and other defoliants.,1
,Fucking PETA,"For all the good points you think you’re making, all the people you’re preaching to hear is “Hur de hurr, let’s hug and fuck trees! I want a branch up my butt!” At least that is what you are pretty sure they think based on their reaction. Nobody likes a proselytiser, but damned if you won’t try anyway!",1
,Reverse Vegans,"Your nation has gone past the hippy treehugger phase into an evolutionary refusal to harm plants. They’ve become obligate carnivores, and not for the native life if something foreign is on the cards.",1
,Celestiopathy,"(Requires Living World): Turns out that the planet is also capable of independently loving itself, which manifests in it having a rather low care for such pesky things as other lifeforms or its own biosphere. Sometimes it just wants to erupt in peace, you know? Who are they to tell it that there's a city there, it's their problem not its. And that's aside from the local sun being a little too cold so it decides to go have a spa day next to the nearest Neutron Star.",1
,,,
Industrialist Nation,,,
,Rebellious Underclass,Turns out that building your nation on the backs of the citizens regardless of things like ‘feelings’ or the like makes an angry populace and sometimes it feels like your military spends more time suppressing riots than defending your nation.,1
,Resource Starved,Your nation is an absolute glutton for raw resources and struggles to meet anything like its production quotas. In emergency situations they may depend far more strongly on cannibalising existing material for the raw resources.,1
,Slave Masters,"You have a cabal of dark masters that have driven your nation to their extremes, powerful and terrible with technology you don’t understand, if you fail to pay your significant tithes, you may find yourself on the brink of a terrible retribution.",1
,Enthusiastic but Inept,"You aren’t a bunch of strip mining titans of industry for any sensible reason, they are that way because of how horrifically inept and wasteful they are, your spoiled resource pits, industrial waste and the like outweighs the working product.",1
,Catastrophic Construction,"Your cities and mining suffer from severe overlap between the massive weight of hive cities and the undermining in the quest for ever more elusive resources, groundquakes are a common, or even daily, occurrence, and ‘the big one’ is always just around the corner, until it happens and entire lower levels of city are crushed by the weight of the city above. (Required with the Forge World trait.)",1
,Quality Control,"Industrialists, due to the high-volume nature of their work do suffer in the quality department and their ships and equipment is generally substandard to others. This can lead to all sorts of accidents as well when a particularly poorly designed piece fails at just the right moment to be a major problem.",1
,,,
Risen Peoples,,,
,Tech Illiteracy,"(Mandatory flaw for all Risen Peoples) You do not truly understand the technology of your creators. You have a limited ability to copy and maintain the simpler technology, but overall you have replaced more advanced equipment with crude technology that is cheap and mass producible.",1
,Belligerent Primitives,"Your people are belligerent, cruel, and downright primitive, diplomacy with them is an exercise in patience that more established nations and people are unwilling to put into practice.",1
,Ruined Homeworld,"You have ruined your homeworld beyond any reasonable hope of recovery, while still inhabitable you simply lack anything like the terraforming technology to overcome it, and worse you lack the trust to accept help in doing so.",1
,Max is Mad,"There is an unhealthy individualistic streak in your people leading there to be significant warbands vying for power and leadership, it is typical for your government to suffer major upsets periodically or even change hands wholesale.",1
,Genophage,"You… really REALLY upset someone and they deployed a bioweapon intended to punish you that has lead to the majority of children being stillborn, as such you have been forced to adopt draconian breeding programs simply to maintain numbers let alone grow. And the slightest upset of that could lead to a catastrophic failure.",1
,Children,"Your status has left you to be regarded as someone that needs to be protected, from others, and from each other. More developed nations may often try to extend their hands protectively whether you like it or not and they aren't interested in whether you consent to their interference.",1
,,,
Spaceborn Collective,,,
,Gravity Sickness,"(Spaceborn Collectives must take this flaw.) Your people can no longer handle moderate or heavier gravities, your ships cannot accelerate as fast as most others and you will never be able to survive descent to a heavy gravity world.",1
,Pressure Vessel,"Your civilisation has hurtled itself into space and forsaken the comfort of planets. This has left you in the void of space protected only by the armour and shields of your habitats, where they are less protected by a thick atmosphere. Your habitats being cracked is typically apocalyptic for the majority of their population.",1
,Atrophied Immune Systems,"As a result of living in engineered environments for so long, your people haven’t been exposed to very many pathogens. Which in turn means that if someone does get infected, it’s so much worse than normal. It gets even worse if the disease is one that can spread.",1
,Exotic Atmosphere Mix,"Your people have spent so long in the vacuum of space that, after decades of tinkering, even if they respirate the same gases as everyone else, the exact mixture is so specific and precise that they have difficulty breathing in any other combination. The same may or may not apply inversely for other species. Bring an encounter suit!",1
,Devalued Garden Worlds,"Having such a penchant for simply building places to live means you don’t view garden worlds with the same value as others. And they get so mad if you do things like strip-mine garden worlds for habitat materials. It’s just good sense! You already know those places have all the materials needed to sustain life, so why not put them to more efficient use?",1
,Delicate Garden Systems,"Spaceborn habitats are closed environmental systems, but ones that lack a true planet's biodiversity leaving them open for cascade failures if issues interfere with any section of the biosphere. A single problem can snowball into a nutrient failure for the life support that would kill an entire Habitat.",1
,,,
Theocracy,,,
,Doctrine is the law of the Almighty,"Your people, your nation live according to ancient doctrines passed down from generations and should be followed by everyone. That the alien races don’t know the doctrine is their mistake not yours and any good diplomatic relations could be thrown out of the window instantly when all of a sudden the foreign diplomat breaks the divine rule of ""Thou shall not pick your nose on the seventh hour of the seventh day of the seventh month!”",1
,Science equals Heresy,Science... It brings the means to further spread the word of the divine but sometimes scientists discover something that is against doctrine and which is instantly labelled as heresy and dealt with severely.,1
,CRUSADE!!!,"When a Theocracy’s Shrineworlds are attacked there is no greater insult to them and their religion. The Theocracy will almost instantly go into a state of total unrelenting war. They WILL mobilise ships and armies, they WILL attack almost mindlessly. However they WILL prioritise re-taking their Shrineworlds over any other consideration.",1
,No Thanks,"You might be a bit too preachy, even for a theocracy, your neighbours have a strong habit of rejecting your nation, its faith and everything else. You just really aren’t really welcome. At least they’re usually polite… usually.",1
,Refusal to Adapt,"Your nation’s doctrines, religion and culture has made it dangerously incapable of adapting to new threats in a timely manner and are more likely to dismiss a threat until significant damage is done.",1
,Pure as a Puritan,"Your nation is particularly vulnerable to contraband because of the sheer amount of stuff that your faith forbids people to engage in. Like, smut, I can sort of understand, but who bans pineapples?!",1
,,,
Warlord State,,,
,Military Intelligence,"The Warlords are not the universe's most natural intelligence gatherers. While they can keep their own information secure as well as anyone, their attempts at gathering information could be described as bumbling at best.",1
,Walkers,"For some unfathomable reason, your nation promoted someone with a mech obsession into a position of power and influence, this could normally be compensated for, however your nation just isn’t very good at it. Instead of regular armoured vehicles you deploy mechs and walkers. And not great ones either.",1
,The Enemy can Drown in the Blood of our Dead!,"(Cannot take with Master Military) Your generals are strong believers in the calculus of war, namely, if their numbers are bigger, they win, HAHA! They will throw your troops, armour, ships and cooks at the enemy to drown them beneath superior numbers. Even if outnumbered.",1
,Sore Losers,"(Cannot take with Master Military) Your leadership is topheavy with sycophantic figures, demagogues and the cattle that follow them, instead of learning from their errors, when faced with defeat the generals and leaders often choose to take their own lives to dispel the shame of their actions.",1
,Crippled by Beancounters,"Your government is not quite up to scratch with the concept of a dictatorship, and decisions by the civil government will all too often cripple or tie the hands of the military to prosecute the actions that are necessary in the near future.",1
